of Airline Costs," Journal of Air Law and Commerce, Vol.21, #3, pp.282-292.

Description: Regression relating 
Response) Operating Costs per revenue ton-mile
to 7 factors: 
1）length of flight, 
2） speed of plane, 
3） daily flight time per aircraft,
4） population served, 
5） ton-mile load factor, 
6） available tons per aircraft mile,
7） firms net assets. 

Regression based on natural logarithms of all
factors, except load factor. Load factor and available tons (capacity)
for Northeast Airlines was imputed from summary calculations.
